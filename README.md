Second web project, this time building my own Giphy search engine (with a Giphy API key).
Users are able to type in a search phrase, click submit, then the site will query the Giphy API based off of the search that the user has entered.
The technologies used were HTML, CSS, SCSS, & JS. 
Ideas for future improvement:
    Create space in between rows and columns
    Display a set of trending GIFs on the landing page
    Add social media links to the home page
