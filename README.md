Second web project, this time building my own Giphy search engine (with a Giphy API key).
Users can use the page by searching for a particular GIF or sticker, click the search button to display their search, and save the image if they would like (possibly add it in an email or instant message). 
The technologies used were HTML, CSS, SCSS, & JS. 
Ideas for future improvement:
    Create space in between rows and columns
    Display a set of trending GIFs on the landing page
    Add social media links to the home page
